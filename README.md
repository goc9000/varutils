varutils
========

Various utilities.

eet
---

Performs the reverse function of the standard utility `tee`, i.e. combines data from multiple pipes into a single stream.

sun_graphic
-----------

Generates a glossy icon of the sun. I considered using this for CHARLIE, but in the end I went for the naive line art look.
